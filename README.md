# VirtualBusStops
![Preview](https://i.imgur.com/eXWaj5g.jpg)

This mod for the road editor simulates different types of bus stops for an entered segment id

This is helpful when testing roads with custom bus stop meshes, since the road editor does not have a line tool

**How to use:**
<ol>
<li>Use the ModTools selection tool to find the ID of the segment you want to change</li>
<li>Copy the id number into the segment id textbox</li>
<li>Press the StopLeft/StopRight/StopBoth buttons</li>
</ol>

StopLeft/StopRight/StopBoth are the names of the segment flags enabled when the corresponding buttons are pressed
